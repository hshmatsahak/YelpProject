# YelpProject
This project aims to predict Yelp and Google Maps restaurant ratings using photos from customer reviews. We want to determine how well a model can predict the quality of a restaurant using only image data and compare the accuracy of image-based predictions to the accuracy of predictions generated from metadata and/or sentiment analysis of text reviews. This is interesting for multiple reasons. Firstly, many review sites allow users to post images without an associated rating. Generating a rating makes an image-only review considerably more useful for the purposes of determining the relative quality of different businesses. Secondly, the project allows social media platforms with image data to create travel guide or business recommendation features for users.
